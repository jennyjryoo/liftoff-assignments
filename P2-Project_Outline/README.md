# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is a versatile symptom tracker. It will allow users to enter custom symptoms and track it against time and against possible confounding triggers or other factors that may affect the symptoms. For example, noting diet each day when tracking GI symptoms. Users will be able to create a secure account, enter new symptoms and triggers and review their data in a user friendly dashboard. The tracker will be flexible, so users can use this for physical symptoms or mental health symptoms, or even to track habit formation.

This project was motivated by my own journey with some health issues last year. I was not able to find a simple tracker that helped me track health symptoms with various possible triggers. The goal was to track possible triggers, like a food diary, so I could narrow down what may have caused my symptoms. While there were apps that tracked the symptoms themselves, I could not find a resource that helped track a secondary log of possible contributing factors and see them in a user friendly graph.

### Features
For our MVP, we plan on the following features:

Account management: Users will be able to create a secure account and log into the application. Users will have a profile page.

Symptom entry: Users will be to enter custom labels for symptoms, and be able to log instances of each symptom. We will keep a database with all user entered data.

Data visualization: We will create a dashboard for reviewing the user's symptoms. We plan on using either API or a library to help with creating dynamic, user friendly charts. Users will be able to filter data they can view in the chart (such as entering a date range).

Beyond our MVP, we would like to add additional features such as:
- Single sign on for account creation
- Create and save "factors", such as possible triggers for symptoms, in addition to symptoms
- A user friendly "quick add" page to quickly adding symptoms or factors that commonly repeat
- Ability to delete previous entries of symptoms or factors
- Ability to use more advanced filtering, such as filtering by symptom, by factor
- 
### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Javascript
React

### What I'll Have to Learn
We will have to build on the skills we learned in both the Java and Javascript courses to build our application. For account management, we will need to learn how to integrate single sign on.

We will also have to learn quite a bit to create a dashboard and integrate charts and analytics into our app. We have not yet decided on which route we will take to create and display our charts, so we will need to finish our research, discuss as a group and finally, learn how to the use the API/library we chose.
